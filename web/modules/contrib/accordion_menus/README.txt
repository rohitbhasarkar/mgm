INTRODUCTION
------------

This module will display a Drupal menu using a jQuery UI accordion effect. The
top-level menu items are referred to as header items. The accordion effect is
invoked when the triggering event occurs on a header item. The triggering event
may be a mouse down, mouse click, or mouse over. The submenu expands to display
the menu items beneath the header. A subsequent triggering event on the same
header item collapses the menu beneath it.
